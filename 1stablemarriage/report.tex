  \section{Results}

  \todo[inline]{Briefly comment the results, did the script say all your solutions were correct? Approximately how long time does it take for the program to run on the largest input? What takes the majority of the time?}
  The algorithm works on all test inputs according to the test.
  4testhuge.in takes just over 6 seconds to process. In my case, around 4 of those seconds is just to load the input.

  \section{Implementation details}

  \todo[inline]{How did you implement the solution? Which data structures were used? Which modifications to these data structures were used? What is the overall running time? Why?}
  I used python dictionaries and lists to store the program data.
  The people's preferences in python dictionaries with the sorted list of preferences as the value, one per gender.
  The set of current matches is stored in a python lists.
